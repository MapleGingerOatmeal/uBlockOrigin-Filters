# uBlock Origin Filter List

## Disclaimer

This repository contains a **highly opinionated and likely non-optimized** set of cosmetic filters for [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock), designed to hide various elements that personally annoy me across websites I frequent. The filter list includes comments explaining what each rule blocks or modifies, along with rationale for certain choices when needed for clarity.

These filters are based on my own browsing habits and preferences, so they may not align to your needs. Some filters might cause unexpected layout issues or break functionality on certain sites.

Use at your own discretion.

## How to subscribe

To subscribe to this filter list and receive automatic updates:

1. Open **uBlock Origin** and select **Filter lists**.
2. Find **Import...** at the bottom of the page, then copy and paste the following raw URL in the textbox below: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MapleGingerOatmeal/uBlockOrigin-Filters/refs/heads/main/uBlockOrigin-StaticFilters.txt`
3. Make sure to choose **Apply Changes** before exiting.

This filter list will now appear under the **Custom** submenu. This will allow you to receive updates automatically and to toggle it on and off for troubleshooting purposes.

## Reporting issues

If you encounter any website breakage or unexpected behavior while using this filter list:

1. Temporarily disable this filter list in uBlock Origin to verify it's the cause
2. [Open an issue](https://github.com/MapleGingerOatmeal/uBlockOrigin-Filters/issues/new) with the following information:

Please note that since this is a personal project, I may prioritize fixes and suggestions based on my own usage patterns, but all feedback is appreciated and helps improve the list.
